		<h1>Drops: An ecosystem-wide distribution mechanism</h1>
		<h2>What is a Drop?</h2>
		<p>
			Each individual Drop is a unique, non-fungible piece of data owned by a specific account which
			is backed by {sizeDropRow} bytes of RAM.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyone is free to create as many unique Drops as they'd like by using their own network
			resources. These Drops can then be used by other applications as seed data in various types of
			algorithms in a provably fair manner, with each Drop representing a unique outcome.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using a Drop with another application can happen in multiple ways, which is decided by
			creators of that application. The application could require you verify ownership of a Drop,
			have a Drop from during/before a specific epoch, transfer a Drop to their contract, or even
			asking you to Destroy a drop to participate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Drops can also be traded between accounts and destroyed to reclaim the RAM (bound) or RAM
			value (unbound) that was used to create it.
		</p>
		<h2>Are Drops a form of inscription?</h2>
		<p>
			At the most primitive level, yes - Drops are a form of inscription. However, Drops are not
			inscriptions in the traditional sense. Drops are not associated directly with any project or
			even any fungible token through use of an ordinal, they are instead guaranteed unique
			non-fungible entries in a smart contract that can be used in many different applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			They do share many of the same qualities as inscriptions, such as provable fairness and
			voluntary inclusion. This voluntary resource consumption allows them to be used as the basis
			of a ecosystem-wide distribution system or as seed data for cryptographic algorithms.
		</p>
		<h2>How do I create a Drop?</h2>
		<p>
			Drops can be created on the <a href="/generate">Generate</a> page. This page allows users to select
			the number of drops to create and shows a detailed breakdown of the costs involved. Currently offers
			two methods to create a Drop.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Use tokens to purchase RAM automatically</strong></p>
				<p>
					An account with a token balance can send tokens directly to the smart contract to create
					one or more drops. The smart contract will use the tokens sent to automatically purchase
					the exact amount of RAM required to create the amount of Drops requested.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any excess tokens sent during this transfer that are not used to purchase RAM for the
					creation of Drops will be automatically returned to the sender.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using this method will create an <strong>unbound</strong> Drop. The smart contract will control
					the RAM resources used to create the Drop until the Drop is either destroyed or is later bound
					to a specific account.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Use an accounts own RAM quota</strong></p>
				<p>
					An account with an available RAM quota may use its own resources to create one or more
					Drops. Creating a Drop using this method will use the exact RAM amount required directly
					from the creators account.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using this method will create a Drop that is <strong>bound</strong> to the account that created
					it. The account that created the Drop will retain control of the RAM resources used to create
					it. It will not be tradable unless made unbound in the future.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>What are bound vs unbound Drops?</h2>
		<p>
			Every Drop that exists is either <strong>bound</strong> or <strong>unbound</strong>. This
			property signifies two things about a Drop:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Whether the owner of the Drop or the Drops smart contract controls the RAM</li>
			<li>Whether a Drop may be traded to another account.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			A Drop which is <strong>bound</strong> is locked to a specific account and cannot be traded.
			The underlying RAM resources for bound Drops are controlled by the owner. The opposite of this
			is a Drop that is <strong>unbound</strong>, which is unlocked and may be traded to other
			accounts. The underlying RAM resources of an unbound DropÂ is controlled by the smart contract.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each Drop can be switched between these two states at any time by the owner of the Drop. The
			act of switching between these two modes requires the owner to pay the network fees for the
			operation, as well as use their own EOS and/or RAM to shift the Drop between these two states.
		</p>
		<h2>Are there any fees when creating a Drop?</h2>
		<p>Yes, network fees are required to create a Drop.</p>
		<p>
			The creation of a Drop consumes all 3 native network resources: CPU, NET, and RAM. The buying
			and selling of RAM to the system contract has a 0.5% fee. The rental of CPU and NET also has a
			cost through the Powerup system. All of the fees collected from these systems are paid to EOS
			token holders who stake their tokens in REX (the Resource Exchange).
		</p>
		<p><strong><u>No additional fees are taken by the Drops system.</u></strong></p>
		<p>
			The Drops smart contracts will always remain at a zero token balance. The RAM balance of the
			Drops smart contract will slowly increase over time as Drops are created and destroyed due to <a
				href="https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.system/issues/30"
				>an unresolved bug in the precision of the Bancor algorithm</a
			>. This extra RAM will be utilized by the contract for additional data storage.
		</p>
		<h2>What is an Epoch?</h2>
		<p>
			An epoch is the simple numeric representation of time since the Drops project launched. When
			the Drops project launches, epoch 1 will begin. After a set amount of time passes, the epoch
			will advance to 2. This process will repeat for the life of the smart contract.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each Drop created is automatically associated to the epoch it was created in. When a Drop is
			created it starts in an immature state and will remain that way until the next epoch. Once the
			next epoch begins, the Drop will be considered mature and can be combined with the epoch seeds
			provided by the oracles for use in applications and algorithms.
		</p>
		<h2>What is an Oracle?</h2>
		<p>
			An oracle is a designated account that is responsible for providing a random seed for each
			epoch. During each epoch, these oracles participate in a commit and reveal process to add
			unique salt for use in cryptographic algorithms and other applications.
